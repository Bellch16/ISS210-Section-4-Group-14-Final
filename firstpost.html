                        <p>Animals in zoos are highly mistreated. They are put in cages away from their natural habitats and used for monetary gains. One point is that many of these animals are social creatures and they don’t get the same social l interactions incaged as they do in the wild. Zoos can hurt animals social because it’s not natural for the animals and sometimes they cause self harm to themselves because of their circumstances and that is a big point on why things need to change. Higher standards for zoos would eliminate animals from being unsocialble it would allow them to have ‘friends’ nearby other than being alone or with another animal.</p>
                        <p>Animals at zoos are usually bred at the zoos. They don’t know how life would be outside and they are highly stressed in their conditions. Accidents can happen because of this. For example people falling in cages and getting attacked. If we had higher standards for zoos 1.)People wouldn’t fall in cages and 2.) animals could be in environment’s that cause the least amount of stress for them. These animals that have been at the zoos all their lives shouldn’t be there. They should be out in the wild where they belong unless they need help. Higer funding would allow for animals that need help to get help.</p>
                        <p>Animals bred in captivity are very expensive. Keeping any animal is expense. Animals need a enviornment similar to their natural habitats and it is hard to provide that. Personally, a couple of the zoos i’ve been to the animals have been malnourished. That coupled with the fact that zoos are pay-to-view kind of hurts. The zoos using animals for monetary gain and then not treating them right doesn’t seem morally correct.</p>
                        <p>Having more regulation on zoos and maybe even more grants would help improve the zoo’s conditions for people and animals. That’s why zoos should be regulated and changed away from a pay-to-view model to a rehabilitation location. If they aren’t helping the animals they shouldn’t be able to charge you to see them.

                        <p>Throughout the history of zoos there has been evidence of severe boredom in zoos affecting the animals that call them home. Many zoo animals show signs of boredom and stress such as head bobbing and swaying.</p>
                        <p>The feelings of animals needs to be introduced to children when they start going to zoos as it is important that when a person thinks of zoos they have a greater understanding of the boredom and emotions that must be going through an animal's head as it is being watched while it probably feels trapped and anxious in their enclosures. Zoo’s would need to change if people stopped visiting and they stopped getting money. Now i’m not saying stop going because that would affect the animals, but we need to speak up against the cruelty some animals experience. The best way to help them is to bring awareness to the problem and push for legislation to create ‘bare minimum’ requirements to be humane.</p>
