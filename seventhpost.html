                        <p>The issue of zoos and animal captivity is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. Some animal rights activists argue that zoos deprive animals of their natural rights and can cause stress, boredom, and illness. Critics also question the effectiveness of zoos in contributing to animal conservation, arguing that they may prioritize entertainment over true conservation efforts. However, some experts argue that zoos play a critical role in preserving endangered species and furthering scientific research. Zoos can provide a safe haven for animals at risk of extinction, and researchers can study animal behavior and genetics to aid in conservation efforts. Furthermore, zoos can serve as an educational tool for raising awareness and inspiring action to protect wildlife and their habitats. Ultimately, whether zoos are ethical or not depends on how they are managed and the priority placed on animal welfare and conservation efforts. </p>
                        <p>  While captivity is difficult to avoid entirely, there are ways to make it more humane for zoo animals. Given the diverse array of animal species held in captivity, it is often impractical to provide them with an environment identical to their natural habitat. However, there is a proposed solution to this issue put forth by KARA, a South Korean animal rights organization.<p>
                        <p>The idea is to keep animals in captivity within an environment that closely replicates their natural habitat. This would make them feel more comfortable, reducing their levels of depression and boredom. To achieve this, exhibits should not only visually resemble the animals' natural environment but should also feel, smell, and be at a similar temperature<p>
                        <p>While this change may seem obvious, many zoos fail to implement it effectively. Fortunately, South Korea has been leading the way in this regard, and their efforts over the past decade have yielded significant benefits for zoo animals' well-being.<p>
                        <p>Culling practices in zoos often involve the euthanization of healthy animals and are unfortunately quite common. Typically, culling occurs when a particular species of animal has a surplus population that the zoo can no longer afford to care for. In such cases, the animal may be sent to a non-AZA accredited facility where they will either be euthanized or forced to live out their days in substandard conditions, resulting in a life of unhappiness and suffering. <p>
                        <p>Culling practices in zoos often involve the euthanization of healthy animals and are unfortunately quite common. Animals may be sent to non-AZA accredited facilities, where they live in substandard conditions, resulting in a life of unhappiness and suffering. It is unacceptable to allow them to be euthanized or live in deplorable conditions simply because zoos lack funding to provide for them properly. We must find more compassionate and ethical solutions to address this issue.
